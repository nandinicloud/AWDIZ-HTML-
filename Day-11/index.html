        The array representation of a binary tree has several advantages. 
        It is simple to implement and understand, and it takes less memory compared to other representations, 
    such as the linked representation. However, it also has some disadvantages. 
    For example, it can be difficult to insert or delete nodes from the tree, and it can be inefficient to search for a specific node in the tree.

        A power amplifier, is an impressive electronic marvel designed to magnify the strength of a signal with sheer power.
         It takes a feeble electrical signal and unleashes its potential, elevating it to a higher power level fit for
          commanding speakers, antennas, or other robust devices that hunger for strength.

            The list is not required to be contiguously present in the memory. The node can reside any where in the memory and linked together to make a list. This achieves optimized utilization of space.
          list size is limited to the memory size and doesn't need to be declared in advance.

        A queue is a linear data structure that stores elements in a First In First Out (FIFO) manner.
            means that the first element added to the queue will be the first element removed from the queue.
         Queues are often used to manage tasks or data that needs to be processed in a specific order.
